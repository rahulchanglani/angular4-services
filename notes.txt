 WRONG way to use service !!!! Don't create instatnces manually ... 
    
    Use dependency injector instead & add in providers property of component
    
    const service = new LoggingService();
    service.logStatusChange(accountStatus);
    


Also create service without importing @injectable. 
If you import @injectable, then mention service name in provider in app.module





Hierarchial injector
====================


AppModule - Same instatnce of service is available Application-wide

AppComponent - Same instatnce of service is available for all components (but not for other services). 
                Instances don't propagate up, they only propagate down.

Any other component (single component not having child component) - Same instatnce of service is available for the component & all its child components





metadata to be attached , if one service is injected into other service
